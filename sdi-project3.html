<p>I choose the tell about my life right now and how busy I am, but I'm trying to juggle in all around.</p>
<p>Most of you already know that I currently attend FSO for MDV, but I also work a full time job as a Remote Tech Support Agent for GeekSquad mainly. It is a work from home paid by the jobs I complete like PC Tuneup, Diagnostic, Printer Install etc. Most Importantly I have three great kids, wife whom I've had the luxury of being with for over 11 years and My Mother that is very needy. I guess that happened with age.</p>
